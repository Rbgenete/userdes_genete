		During the SOCIT week we were introduced with technology of the modern world, cyber security. During the conference we were introduced to an amazing virtual reality set which allows the users to make their environment their canvas. That was very exciting to see because it sees the environment and interact with the place, using data mapping to create an image or a representation of an object that you can interact with without any need for controllers, just your hands and the headset, and using the environment as a canvas meaning it will interact with the surroundings as if it were a real scenario; sample is the game with the robot shooter. Making it a better augmented reality unlike the Pokemon go with its limited access of power due to phone limitations. As we further develop it in the future and is accessible for even an average person to buy, I will likely buy one in the future.</p>

Fortunately thinking it is confidential I didn`t take pictures of the examples for anyone to see. Let`s just hope it will come sooner and gives a nice discount to boot.
	There was also the conference about cyber security awareness. I learned that everything can be hack and be used to view the location, see confidential files just by using google. If you think about it even if you are just looking at puppy videos in the internet someone might also be viewing you from their monitor and that is very disturbing. Now I have a good idea why my pc and phone always request to update frequently, and I have gained deep respect for the developers who constantly update their platforms to protect us consumers from cyber terrorism and virus infections.
SOCIT week gave me a deeper understanding why it is important for our technology to improve and be available for everyone. It can save a lot of people using the technology, but it can also destroy us if handled incorrectly.
