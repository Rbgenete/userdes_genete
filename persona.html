<h1><b>Persona</b></h1>

<p>This is an Activity page for the Personas. Where we create fictional people with specific attributes that might use our app.</p>

<p>What is a Persona?
	According to the Interaction Design Foundation, personas are fictional characters that you create based on your research in order to represent the different user types that may potentially use your service, product, site, or brand. These fictional characters will help us in designing our project. We can use them to analyze the needs, experiences, goals and behaviors of our target users.
</p>	
<p>Here are the following Personas that we created using Hubspot:
